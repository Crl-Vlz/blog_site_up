### Daily Log

**_Oct 14th_**

- Got together to decide general attributes of the website and technology to use.

**_Oct 17th_**

- Got together to decide general layout of the app and start preliminary sketches.

**_Oct 18th to Oct 24th_**

- Divided the workload and started working on the website.
  - Eduardo worked on the back-end, making the methods used by the server.
  - Lucia worked as a full-stack, mostly focused on the back-end but also helping with the front-end.
  - Carlos worked on the front-end, making the preliminary designs and selecting the CSS framework to use.
- During this time we encountered some problems with the front-end, caused by our inexperience with Material Design.We solved it by checking the documentation and online tutorials.
- On the back-end, the main problem was when impementing the server script. At first it was written with the intention of recieving params, but at the end it was changed to use the document body. To fix this Eduardo checked online documentation and installed some node packages.
- Another front-end problem was the responsiveness on mobile. Testing and constant tweaking solved this problem.

**_Oct 25th to Oct 26th_**

- Due to problems with the Material Design Components, Carlos checked the documentation again and made several .js files needed to control the behavior of the components correctly, this had the added benefit of adding more responsiveness.
- Started connecting the front-end with the back-end. During this period of time we suffered several setbacks, which inluded problems such as lack of response, wrong parameters, and the server not creating the html needed. Eduardo and Lucia broke their backs checking the documentation and configuring the files needed. They changed the folders used due to the fact that the server ereased the css files, or at least wasn't reading them.
- During the final day of work we worked hard to make sure the back-end was able to respond correctly to all the inputs we needed. Eduardo and Lucia in that sense made sure the JQuery got the coorrect elements and the server returned the correct files.
- Carlos deployed the app to Heroku, supervised the Github and configured the package.json and Procfile.
